Our new poolside restaurant and bar, Toasted Coconut, fits the bill. With its palm tree shade and gorgeous pool view, it&rsquo;s the perfect spot to get &ldquo;toasted.&rdquo; Here&rsquo;s what we like to order when we&rsquo;re #feelingtoasted:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Course 1: Toasted Punch</h4>\n<p>The perfect meal in Key West starts with a stiff drink. Toasted Coconut&rsquo;s Toasted Punch delivers. With three different flavored rums - coconut, mango, and pineapple, and the corresponding fresh fruit juices, this drink does the trick so well, you probably won&rsquo;t notice until you stand up. But do you need to? You&rsquo;ll be lounging comfortably at 24 North.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img id=\"1491894806124\" class=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/359_384_2618/media/2017-04-11-030931/24-North-Bar-Toasted-Coconut.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Course 2: Conch Fritters</h4>\n<p>To balance out your Toasted Punch, start with an island favorite off Toasted Coconut&rsquo;s Munchies menu - the Conch Fritters. The caviar of Key West, our conch fritters are lightly fried, easily addictive, and the perfect introduction to the Conch Republic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Course 3: Dynamite Tacos</h4>\n<p>Another staple of the Conch Republic diet, our Dynamite fish tacos our overflowing with lightly-breaded shrimp, lettuce, tomatoes, and topped with fresh sour cream and our secret, house-made spicy sauce. Order these to share, but make sure to save room for the main course.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img id=\"1491894864212\" class=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/359_384_2618/media/2017-04-11-030932/24-North-Cheeseburger.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Course 4: Sun of a Bun</h4>\n<p>Sometimes you just need a good old-fashioned burger. Toasted Coconut is up to the challenge. Our juicy, half-pound burger comes topped with crispy bacon and melted cheddar cheese, and is served with plantain chips for the true island experience.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Course 5: Rumshine Strawberry Mojito</h4>\n<p>In Key West, we believe in drinking your dessert. That said, after you&rsquo;ve eaten your heart out, try the Rumshine Strawberry Mojito for a little something sweet to help you digest. Our signature mojito comes with strawberry rumshine, fresh mint, lime juice and club soda, for the ultimate refresher to end your afternoon meal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Sounds delicious?
