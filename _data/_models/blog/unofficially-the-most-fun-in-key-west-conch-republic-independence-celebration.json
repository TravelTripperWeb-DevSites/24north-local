The island becomes extra-animated with parties celebrating the Conch Republic Independence Celebration, when Key West seceded from the United States. Festivities include <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/conch-blowing-contest-key-west/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a conch-shell blowing contest</a>, the longest parade in the world, the great bloody sea battle...</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But let&rsquo;s back up.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For those who don&rsquo;t know, the Conch Republic was established in 1982 after the U.S. Border Patrol set up a roadblock on one of the two roads that connects Key West to the mainland, which resulted in heinous traffic jams. Key West residents protested after seeing this act as a threat to their livelihood and the tourism industry. However, they didn&rsquo;t use banners, signs and marches &ndash; they seceded.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Well, not officially.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Key West Mayor Dennis Wardlow declared the secession as more of a joke than an actual act of treason. And while the actual &ldquo;revolution&rdquo; lasted only a minute, the roadblock was later removed. Today, festivities surrounding the Conch Republic Independence Day are on their 37th year, driven by the republic&rsquo;s mission &ldquo;to bring humor, warmth and respect to a world in sore need of all three.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Locals never miss an opportunity to exhibit their &ldquo;sovereign state of mind&rdquo; &ndash; as you&rsquo;ll see in their annual celebrations.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1550791223543\" class=\" \" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1550791207/vwgop1wzm9uqbmyb2zgi.jpg\" alt=\"bourbon-beach-boys\" width=\"662\" height=\"282\" data-image-large=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1550791207/vwgop1wzm9uqbmyb2zgi.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_992,w_992/v1550791207/vwgop1wzm9uqbmyb2zgi.jpg\" data-image-small=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_768,w_768/v1550791207/vwgop1wzm9uqbmyb2zgi.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_300,w_300/v1550791207/vwgop1wzm9uqbmyb2zgi.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,h_140,w_140/v1550791207/vwgop1wzm9uqbmyb2zgi.jpg\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This year&rsquo;s Conch Republic Independence Celebration kicks off April 19 with a party at the <a href=\"http://www.schoonerwharf.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Schooner Wharf Bar</a>, the official &ldquo;unofficial&rdquo; bar of the Conch Republic.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other events include <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/conch-blowing-contest-key-west/\">a conch shell blowing contest</a>, the &ldquo;Great Bloody Sea Battle&rdquo; (fought with water guns and stale bread), and the World&rsquo;s Longest Parade, which spans from the Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other worthwhile activities include the annual Drag Race, raced by drag queens. Men from all walks of life stuff their shirts, dawn crazy-colored wigs and scant around in tight, short skirts, all while racing to complete an obstacle course filled with tires, shopping carts and tightropes down Duval.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Not to be outdone is the Red Ribbon Bed Race, a more elaborate soap-box derby race down Key West&rsquo;s main drag, Duval Street. Touted as the most fun you can have in bed with your clothes on, teams dress up beds-on- wheels and compete for the fastest time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So pack your costumes, grab a bottle of rum and &ldquo;secede where others failed.&rdquo; Get to the Conch Republic Independence Celebration&nbsp;from April 19 to May 1, 2019, and stay at the <a href=\"https://24northhotel.reztrip.com/\">24 North Hotel</a>, the &ldquo;unofficial&rdquo; hotel of the Conch Republic. We&rsquo;re located about 10 minutes from all the festivities.</p>",
