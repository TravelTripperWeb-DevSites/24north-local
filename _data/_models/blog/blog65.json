It&rsquo;s an island at the end of Florida, closer to Cuba than the rest of its state. Its visitors and old-timers have breathed a life of weird into the island.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were going to round up the weirdest Key West stories, but some are so wildly bizarre, we wanted to delve in deep. Here&rsquo;s a Key Weird story of the real corpse bride.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">(Full disclosure -- this story is a bit graphic. It&rsquo;s a love story to some; to others it&rsquo;s a prolonged story of demented obsession.)</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">German immigrant Karl Tanzler first laid eyes on Maria Elena Milagro de Hoyos in 1930. Tanzler was working at the U.S. Maritime Hospital in Key West. Elena&rsquo;s mother brought her in to be revised for what was eventually discovered to be tuberculosis.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tanzler, in his 50s at the time, believed that Maria Elena, 21, was his true love that he had seen in dreams over the years. Tanzler dedicated his time and money to paying for Maria Elena&rsquo;s medical expenses until she died the following year in 1931. Records show that Elena wasn&rsquo;t in love with Tanzler and often told him he was old enough to be her grandfather. &nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In what many thought was a show of great affection, Tanzler provided Elena&rsquo;s body with a large mausoleum in the Key West Cemetery. Her family thought it was oddly generous and appreciated the gesture. Tanzler would often go to the cemetery to visit his dearly departed. One day in 1933, Tanzler decided to bring her corpse home with him.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is where the weird gets Weirder. Tanzler began to dedicate his time to preserving Maria Elena&rsquo;s corpse; stuffing her chest cavity, connecting her bones with wire hangers and dousing her corpse in perfume and formaldehyde. He covered her face with wax and was often seen around town buying women&rsquo;s clothing for his new, stay-at-home wife.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After years, rumors went around town and Maria Elena&rsquo;s sister got wind of the news. She confronted Tanzler at his home in 1940, where she saw her sister&rsquo;s corpse. He said he was working on various experiments to bring Maria Elena her back to life.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The day that Tanzler left for his new life, Maria Elena&rsquo;s mausoleum exploded in the cemetery. Pieces of her shattered tomb are now on display at the <a href=\"http://www.kwahs.org/museums/fort-east-martello/history\">Fort East Martello Museum</a>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Have a suggestion for our Key Weird series?
