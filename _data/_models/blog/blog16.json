And that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what we have at 24 North. Our on-site Starbucks has been the icing on the cake, or should we say the whipped cream on our frappucino since it&amp;rsquo;s opening inside the hotel. And as if we weren&amp;rsquo;t excited enough for spring drink season at Starbucks, they&amp;rsquo;ve gone and surprised us with two new flavors, perfect for lounging poolside at 24 North. Welcome home, Iced Cinnamon Almond Milk Macchiato and Coconut Milk Mocha Macchiato, we think you&amp;rsquo;ll like 24 North as much as we do.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now, about our new additions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=\\\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/359_384_1117/media/2017-03-07-023602/Starbucks-Photo2.JPG\\\" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the sweet, agua fresca horchata, the Iced Cinnamon Almond Milk Macchiato is made with Starbucks traditional espresso roast, covered with almond milk, a dash of cinnamon dolce syrup, and drizzled with Starbucks&amp;rsquo; signature caramel sauce. It sounds like a drink made in heaven, which is why we&amp;rsquo;re thinking the Iced Cinnamon Almond Milk Macchiato is perfect for those sunny, not-a-cloud-in-the-sky Key West days. After all, isn&amp;rsquo;t heaven having a Starbucks just steps from your Key West hotel room?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\\\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/359_384_1117/media/2017-03-07-023621/Starbucks-Photo3.JPG\\\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;And then there&amp;rsquo;s the Coconut Milk Mocha Macchiato. You might remember this macchiato from last year when they were testing it out. The Coconut Milk Mocha Macchiato comes with fresh-brewed espresso, creamy coconut milk, and a healthy dose of caramel. It&amp;rsquo;s then swirled to perfection with white chocolate mocha sauce. Can we say to die for? If you like, order it hot. The Key West spring is so pleasant, you won&amp;rsquo;t won&amp;rsquo;t feel the need to douse your drink in ice. In fact, you might want it that way.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;See you at the 24 North Starbucks!&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>"
