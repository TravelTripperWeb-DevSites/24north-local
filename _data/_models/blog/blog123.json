Key West prepares for Fantasy Fest months in advance. Is it too early for you to start planning? Here are some things you can start preparing ahead of time to ensure smooth sailing during this year&rsquo;s Fantasy Fest.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Lodging</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is a big one. Fantasy Fest typically draws approximately 75,000 visitors to the 7.5-sq-mile island of Key West and hotel rooms fill up quickly. Book ahead at <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">24 North Hotel Key West</a>, which offers shuttle services, activities at our <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/weddings-and-events/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sunset Green Event Lawn</a>, onsite food at the Toasted Coconut restaurant, a full bar, clean, well-kept rooms and pool access. If you&rsquo;re looking to enjoy Fantasy Fest but you also want refuge from Old Town during your stay, choose <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">24 North</a>. <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/rooms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Check out rooms here.</a></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Party and event tickets</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The schedule for Fantasy Fest is posted by late spring/early summer and tickets for all the main events typically go on sale in late July. Now is a good time to book tickets for the annual events like the <a href=\"https://keystix.ticketforce.com/eventperformances.asp?evt=1003\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Headdress Ball</a> (this event always sells out), the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/262413914521587/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Living Art Expo</a>, parties, or spots on celebrity party floats during the parade.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Feeling a little overwhelmed? Check the <a href=\"http://www.fantasyfest.com/schedule/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fantasy Fest schedule</a>, which directs you to dates, times, details, and ticket purchases.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Parade game plan</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The parade is the biggest event of the 10-day festival, and choosing whether to book a viewing ticket in advance or to wing it with the big crowd will be the biggest choice you&rsquo;ll make ahead of time. Never been? Here&rsquo;s how it works &ndash; nearly every balcony along Duval Street is usually accessible for parade viewing with a fee, with prices starting at $100 (they only go up). Tickets are bought in advance (that means now!).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is a tempting option for those who want a table away from the crowds, access to a bathroom, drink service, or those who have trouble being on their feet too long or mobility issues.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now is the time to plan the option that best fits your Fantasy Fest desires. Some parade viewing tickets are available through <a href=\"https://keystix.ticketforce.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">KeysTix,</a> notably the Woman&rsquo;s Club viewing party. Bourbon Bar is another popular option.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pro-tip: See the Fantasy Fest parade route on this year&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.fantasyfest.com/pdf/FF18-Parade-Entrant-Manual.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">entrant manual</a> to know what to expect. The most crowded and exciting part of the parade is toward the end of the route at <a href=\"http://lateda.com/\">LaTeDa</a>, near the judge&rsquo;s tables.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now that your homework is done, make sure to check out our guide to <a href=\"https://www.24northhotel.com/blog/5-tips-for-surviving-fantasy-fest-key-west/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Surviving Fantasy Fest.</a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--</p>\n<p>Need a vacation?
