His presence before an audience is something startling and immediate, at times a funk rave-up, other times a sort of mass-absolution for the mortal weaknesses that make him and his audience human. When you see JJ Grey and his band Mofro live&mdash;and you truly, absolutely must&mdash;the man is fearless.<br />Onstage, Grey delivers his songs with compassion and a relentless honesty, but perhaps not until Ol&rsquo; Glory has a studio record captured the fierceness and intimacy that defines a Grey live performance. &ldquo;I wanted that crucial lived-in feel,&rdquo; Grey says of Ol&rsquo; Glory, and here he hits his mark. On the new album, Grey and his current Mofro lineup offer grace and groove in equal measure, with an easygoing quality to the production that makes those beautiful muscular drum-breaks sound as though the band has set up in your living room.</p>\n<div class=\"btn-holder\"><a class=\"button-common btn-blue top-margin\" href=\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1732012\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BUY TICKETS</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-6 no-padding v-center\"><img src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_384_17481/media/2018-07-18-013818/photo2.jpg\" alt=\"Rum Row is the quintessential Key West hangout\" /></div>\n</div>\n</section>"
