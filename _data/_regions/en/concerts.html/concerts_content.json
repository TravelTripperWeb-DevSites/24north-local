The creator of some of the finest power-pop of the &rsquo;80s, a Grammy winning singer, songwriter, and musician who has sold 25 million albums and scored 17 U.S. Top 40 hits, including &ldquo;Jessie&rsquo;s Girl,&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Talk to Strangers,&rdquo; &ldquo;An Affair of the Heart,&rdquo; &ldquo;I've Done Everything for You,&rdquo; &ldquo;Love Somebody,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Human Touch.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s an accomplished actor who has starred opposite Meryl Streep in the feature film Ricki and the Flash, gave a chameleonic performance as the creepy Dr. Pitlor in HBO&rsquo;s prestige drama True Detective, earned great reviews for his portrayal of Lucifer this season on the CW hit, Supernatural and most recently played Pastor Charles on American Horror Story. In 2014, Springfield was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, located around the corner from the first apartment he lived in when he first arrived in the U.S. from Australia in 1971.<br />Rick&rsquo;s latest Album &ldquo;The Snake King&rdquo; finds Rick travelling down a dusty dirt road to explore the blues side of his rock &lsquo;n roll and marks a definite departure from the power pop he has been known for.</p>\n<div class=\"btn-holder\"><a class=\"button-common btn-blue top-margin\" href=\"https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/1728292?utm_medium=bks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TICKETS</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-6 no-padding v-center\"><img src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_384_17339/media/2018-07-11-030730/event.png\" alt=\"Rum Row is the quintessential Key West hangout\" /></div>\n</div>\n</section>"
