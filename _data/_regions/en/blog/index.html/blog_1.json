[{"_template":"html","content":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&lt;p&gt; On April 23, 1982, Key West seceded from the United States, and the Conch Republic was born. The story goes that the U.S. Border Patrol set up a roadblock on one of the two roads that connects the archipelago to the mainland, causing a 17-mile traffic jam on the island. Seeing this act as a threat to their livelihood and the tourism industry, Key West residents protested. However, they didn&rsquo;t use banners, signs and marches &ndash; they seceded.&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;p&gt;Well, not officially.&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;p&gt;Key West Mayor Dennis Wardlow declared the secession as more of a joke than an</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; actual act of treason.
