[{"_template":"html","content":"<p>&lt;p&gt;On April 23, 1982, Key West seceded from the United States, and the Conch Republic was born. The story goes that the U.S. Border Patrol set up a roadblock on one of the two roads that connects the archipelago to the mainland, causing a 17-mile traffic jam on the island. Seeing this act as a threat to their livelihood and the tourism industry, Key West residents protested. However, they didn&rsquo;t use banners, signs and marches &ndash; they seceded.&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;p&gt;Well, not officially.&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;p&gt;Key West Mayor Dennis Wardlow declared the secession as more of a joke than an</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; actual act of treason. And while the actual &ldquo;revolution&rdquo; lasted only a minute, the</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; festivities surrounding the Conch Republic Independence Day are on their 34th year,</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; driven by the republic&rsquo;s mission to &ldquo;bring humor, warmth and respect.&rdquo; In Conch,</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that translates to making almost everything a good-humored joke on politics and</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; patriotism.&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;p&gt;That being said, Conch Republic residents never miss an opportunity to exhibit their</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;sovereign state of mind.&rdquo; The usual festivities for the Conch Republic Independence</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Celebration &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1032923240084229/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;kick off with a party&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"http://www.schoonerwharf.com/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Schooner Wharf Bar&lt;/a&gt;, the officially &ldquo;unofficial&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bar of the Conch Republic, aka where the majority of the after-parties are held.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Other events include the &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1171204672904755/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Wreckers Race&lt;/a&gt; at sunset along Mallory Square, a conch</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; blowing contest and the historic Great Sea Battle with water guns, stale bread and</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cannons.
