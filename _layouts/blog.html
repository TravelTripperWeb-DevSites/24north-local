            <p>Other worthwhile activities include the Red Ribbon Bed Race, a more elaborate
              
              soap-box derby race down Key West’s main drag, Duval Street. Touted as the most
              
              fun you can have in bed with your clothes on, teams dress up beds-on- wheels and
              
              compete for the fastest time.</p>
            <p>Not to be outdone are the Drag Races, yes, literally “drag” races. Men from all walks
              
              of life stuff their shirts, dawn crazy-colored wigs and scant around in tight, short
              
              skirts, all while racing to complete an obstacle course filled with tires, shopping
              
              carts and tightropes down Duval.</p>
            <p>So pack your costumes, grab a bottle of rum and “secede where others failed.” Get to
              
              the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/The-Conch-Republic-380342204001/timeline" target="_blank">Conch Republic Independence Celebration</a> from April 22 to May 1, 2016, and
              
              stay at the <a href="https://bookings.ihotelier.com/24-North-Hotel-Key-West/bookings.jsp?hotelId=98358" target="_blank">24 North Hotel</a>, the “unofficial” hotel of the Conch Republic. We’re located
